      Lung Map + Music Notes
    </h1>

    <p style="margin-top: 8px; max-width: 850px;">
      This page is about breath support (appoggio) and how it connects to singing.
      The lung is the main “map.” The music notes are little moments and thoughts.
    </p>

    <p style="margin-top: 6px;">
      <strong>How to use it:</strong> hover a note = quick hint. click a note = more text opens.
    </p>

    <section id="lung-area" style="margin-bottom: 35px;">
      <h2 style="font-size: 32px; margin-bottom: 8px;">The Lung (main idea)</h2>

      <p style="max-width: 900px;">
        The lung is like the center of the story. Later, with CSS, the notes will sit around it
        like little “memory dots.” For now, the notes are below so everything still works.
      </p>

      <!-- MAIN TEXT (this will go "inside" the lung later with CSS) -->
      <section style="margin-top: 18px; max-width: 900px;">
        <h3 style="margin-bottom: 6px; color: #8b0000;">Main message (goes inside the lung later)</h3>

        <p style="margin-top: 0;">
          I used to think singing was just “breathe from the belly” and go.
          But appoggio is more like control. You inhale low, ribs open, then you don’t let it
          collapse fast. You kind of “lean” on the breath so the sound stays steady.
        </p>

        <p>
          The weird part is… when you start doing it right, your body feels different.
          Like stiff, or sore, or you feel muscles you didn’t know you had.
          It’s annoying, but also it feels real.
        </p>
      </section>

      <!-- NOTES -->
      <section style="margin-top: 18px;">
        <h3 style="margin-bottom: 8px;">Music Notes (click these)</h3>
        <p style="margin-top: 0;">
          Later these will float around the lung. Right now they are just stacked.
        </p>

        <!-- NOTE 1 -->
        <details style="margin-bottom: 10px;">
          <summary title="I thought I had it, but nah">
            ♪ Note 1: The fake confidence phase
          </summary>
          <p>
            I was singing songs and thinking “okay I got support now.”
            But it wasn’t official support. I still had tension and didn’t notice it.
            Then I hit a plateau and got mad.
          </p>
        </details>

        <!-- NOTE 2 -->
        <details style="margin-bottom: 10px;">
          <summary title="lots of trial and error">
            ♫ Note 2: Finding the muscles (finally)
          </summary>
          <p>
            I did breathing drills and kept trying stuff until something clicked.
            When it clicked, I got sore. Like реально sore.
            But I also felt excited because I knew I wasn’t guessing anymore.
          </p>
        </details>

        <!-- NOTE 3 -->
        <details style="margin-bottom: 10px;">
          <summary title="happy and mad at the same time">
            ♩ Note 3: The “I got it” moment
          </summary>
          <p>
            It was a mix of anger and happiness.
            Anger because it took so long. Happiness because I finally felt the support
            in a real way, not just “in my head.”
          </p>
        </details>

        <!-- NOTE 4 -->
        <details style="margin-bottom: 10px;">
          <summary title="support shows up, but it fights your old habits">
            ♬ Note 4: The stiff body part
          </summary>
          <p>
            Once the support muscles showed up, my body felt stiff and kinda weird.
            I had to learn how to keep the ribs open without locking up.
            It takes time to make it feel natural.
          </p>
        </details>

        <!-- NOTE 5 -->
        <details style="margin-bottom: 10px;">
          <summary title="internet research was actually helpful">
            ♪ Note 5: The research spiral
          </summary>
          <p>
            I watched videos and read about appoggio and bel canto.
            It made me realize it’s not “push air.” It’s more like “hold back air”
            so only what you need comes out.

        <ul style="margin-top: 6px;">
          <li>Still singing songs, but support wasn’t real yet</li>
          <li>Plateau hit, started researching more</li>
          <li>More drills, more “why is this not working”</li>
        </ul>

      <article style="margin-bottom: 16px;">
        <h3 style="margin: 0;">Late Dec 2025</h3>
        <ul style="margin-top: 6px;">
          <li>Started doing more controlled breathing drills</li>
          <li>Noticed the “hold back the air” idea</li>
          <li>Felt like progress, but still not automatic</li>
        </ul>
      </article>

      <article style="margin-bottom: 16px;">
        <h3 style="margin: 0;">Jan – Feb 2026</h3>
        <ul style="margin-top: 6px;">
          <li>Some days felt good, some days felt fake again</li>
          <li>Support showed up more but I still had to think about it</li>
          <li>Got emotional because singing is personal for me</li>
        </ul>
      </article>

      <p style="color: #555;">
        Later idea: clicking a timeline part could highlight certain notes.
        (We can do that with JS later, easy.)

      <ul style="max-width: 900px;">
        <li><strong>Appoggio:</strong> “Lean” on the breath. Ribs stay open. Don’t dump air fast.</li>
        <li><strong>Bel canto:</strong> “Beautiful singing.” Smooth sound, not tight, not forced.</li>
        <li><strong>Support:</strong> Not a crunch. More like controlled air + steady body.</li>
        <li><strong>Why the lung:</strong> It’s a body map. Breath is literally the engine.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        This is basically my body learning breath control and my brain learning patience.
        I’m not trying to act like a teacher or anything. I’m just tracking what I felt.
