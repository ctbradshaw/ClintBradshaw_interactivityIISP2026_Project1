          <p>I thought I had support before. I did not.</p>
          <p>I was singing everyday with tension and guessing.</p>
          <p>Then I plateaued and got frustrated for real.</p>
          <p>I started straw drills and Farinelli breathing daily.</p>
          <p>I moved from chest breathing to lower breathing, still leaking air.</p>
          <p>One day I found rib support and everything felt different.</p>
          <p>I got sore and stiff after. Scary at first, but normal.</p>
          <p>Appoggio is not push harder. It is control and hold back air.</p>
          <p>Like a balloon letting out air slowly, not exploding out.</p>
          <p>That is when my notes felt less forced and more stable.</p>
          <p>I had anger and extreme happiness at the same time.</p>
          <p>Finally felt like I actually reached the point I wanted.</p>

          <p>Then I had to stop full songs. That hurt me emotionally.</p>
          <p>Early to late Dec was drills only. Mostly straw and stability checks.</p>
          <p>I used code to check if breath was steady enough.</p>
          <p>January was boring stage. I knew steps, body still not automatic.</p>

          <p>It felt like losing part of my identity for a bit.</p>
          <p>I went numb for about a week, then got neutral and kept going.</p>
          <p>Late Jan to early Feb support started showing up easier.</p>
          <p>Oo and oh are stable now. Ahh still needs work.</p>
          <p>I can lip trill melodies now because support is more automated.</p>
          <p>I still do not rush songs. I wanna protect this progress.</p>
          <p>Less dopamine sessions, more consistency. That was the breakthrough.</p>
